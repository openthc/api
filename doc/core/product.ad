== Products

A Product is an object that represents one unique model of material to be sold.
A Product describes the name, package weight/volume and optionally the Variety (Strain.)
Each Inventory will be linked to a Product (and to a Variety) to describe the Inventory.

An OpenTHC compatible system should be able to understand Bulk items, Individual (Each) retail items, Packaged Retail items.
Specific Product types require Dose/Serving information, including

Package
 qty: 10 (ea)
 qom: 0.6
 uom: g
Serving



=== Source Products

A Bulk Product simply specifies the unit-of-measure, the amount of material is stored in the Inventory Quantity
The Package is always **1 ea** for a Product of this type.
And the Unit is also always **1** with a UOM that will be used to count the Inventory, typically a Weight or Volume unit.

* name = "Bulk Materials"
* package.type = 'bulk'
* package.pack_qom = 1
* package.pack_uom = 'ea'
* package.unit_qom = 1
* package.unit_uom = 'g'

```javascript
{
	"type": "bulk",
	"dose": {}
	"pack": {},
	"unit": {}
}

```


When combined with a Inventory with a Quantity of 2200.000, we would have a single, *2.2 kg* Inventory Lot.


=== Retail Products

A Retail Products are packaged, singled, mulitiples and have varying dosage requirements as well.
These products can be marked as Each, such as single cans of Coke.
Or as a Pack, which is like a case of Coke, with 12 individual units inside.


* name = "Flower Bag"
* package.type = "each"
* package.pack_uom = 1
* package.pack_qom = 'ea'
* package.unit_qom = "3.5"
* package.unit_uom = "g"


* name = "Pre-Roll 1g"
* package_type = "each"
* package_size = "1"
* package_unit = "g"


* name = "Pre-Roll 3 (0.5g each)"
* package_type = "each"
* package_size = 1.5
* package_unit = "g"


=== Retail Products - Packaged Singles

A Retail Product is packaged and ready to be shipped, in a Inventory of a specific quantity to another License.
These however have a total weight represented in package_size and an individual count in package_each

* name = "Pre-Roll 3 (0.5g each)"
* package_type = "pack"
* package_size = 1.5
* package_unit = "g"
* package_each = 3

package: {
	type: "bulk|each|pack"
	size:
	unit:
	pack_size:
	pack_unit:
}

package: {
	type: "bulk"
	size: 1
	unit: "gm",
	pack_size: null,
	pack_unit: null,
}


package: {
	type: "each"
	size: 3.5
	unit: "gm",
	pack_size: null,
	pack_unit: null,
}

package: {
	type: "pack"
	unit_qom: 10
	unit_uom: "mg",
	pack_qom: 10,
	pack_uom: "ea",
}


* name = "Sour Mints"
* package_type = "pack"
* package_size = 200
* package_unit = "mg"
* package_each = 20


* name = "Six Pack of 50ml Things (25mg dose)"
* package_type = "pack"
* package_size = 300
* package_unit = "ml"
* package_each = 6
