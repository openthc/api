=== Plants :: Net Collect

*Net* materials collection is also known as _Curing_ or _Dry Weight_.
These materials are sub-set of the raw materials that will enter the production pipeline.

The *Net Collection* process operates on the group of plants from a *Raw Collection* process.
When entering a Net weight the collection group will be closed and new bulk Inventory will be created.

This call can be repeated for each type of material collected.
